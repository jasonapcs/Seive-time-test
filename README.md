# Sieve-time-test
This tests various implementations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to provide time comparisons  
**warning** with large sizes (1 billion default), this may take some large computing resources (100 MB+ RAM)  
(This is not the most efficient algorithm; it's just a good test of performance with different variables on different machines)  

## How to run
Use any C++ compiler you want that supports C++11 or higher  
Run without debugging at whatever optimization level you want (higher is recommended due to long runtimes)  
Send in your results in the results folder!
